## Pros and Cons between PWA App and Native App

* Pros
 [ ] Offline mode - If there is no internet, you can still connect to the PWA but it will display the pre-configured offline page in the config file. This offline file can be cache by browser
 [ ] Improved performance - Javascript files run separately from the main browser thread and control the caching the assets -> It's improve better performance
 [ ] No installation or manual updates required -> Dont care about update because When updates its PWA, users don’t have to install it manually – all new features and bug fixes are available without any manual action required
 [ ] Platform-specific features: PWAs can live on the user’s home screen and deliver web push notifications that appear just like regular push notifications. They can run in full screen, change display orientation, start with a custom splash screen, access locational data, and much more
 [ ] Low on data: Uses little mobile data
 [ ] App store independent: Dont want to pay Apple annual fee of 99 dollars or Google lifetime fee of $25 just to get their app published

 * Cons
 [ ] Compatibility with iOS version: Since iOS 11.3, it’s been possible to run PWAs on Apple devices, and the PWA cannot using TouchID, FaceID, ... And compatible with Android 
 [ ] Issues with legacy devices: dont support with older mobile devices and outdated with older browser
 [ ] PWAs can’t do everything: Does not optimize battery usage,
